**Maze Game**

Welcome to the Maze Game! This is a simple console-based maze game written in C#. Players can navigate through pre-designed mazes stored in ASCII text files or challenge themselves with randomly generated mazes.

**Features**
Play through pre-designed mazes stored in ASCII text files.
Generate random mazes of variable sizes.
Navigate through the maze using keyboard controls.
Time yourself to see how fast you can reach the end.
Enjoy the challenge of solving mazes of increasing difficulty.


**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**
.NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

**N.B**
This is an unfinished version. If i had more time i would have integrated an algorithm that can solve the .txt file mazes.
I tried with a number of different algorithms and could not get them to work. This solution is more a skeleton of how the
Maze game could have extended functionality leading to a greater user experience.
